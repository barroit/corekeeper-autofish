Note
====

Generated files
---------------
Make sure the mod Scripts/ directory contains a Generated/ directory. The
compiled SystemAPI queries are stored in that place.

Uploading mod
-------------
Be aware that mod.io may wrap an extra directory to the mod zip file, which
will break Core Keeper to load the mod. Making the file name aggressively
unique solves this.

Configuration
-------------
Autofish.asset metadata

	Leave MonoBehaviour.metadata.files empty and let SDK generate it
	for us, as BurstCompile generates files with random names.
