                                     NOTE


Setup project
-------------
Just run scripts/setup.sh. This script creates the necessary symlinks in the
SDK directory.


Generated files
---------------
Ensure that Scripts/Generated/ exists in the mod directory. The compiled
SystemAPI queries will be stored there.


Uploading mod
-------------
Be aware that mod.io may wrap an extra directory around the uploaded mod,
which breaks Core Keeper's mod loading. Giving the zip file an aggressively
unique name tends to avoid this.


Configuration
-------------
autofish.asset metadata:

	Leave MonoBehaviour.metadata.files empty and let the SDK generate it
	for us, since BurstCompile creates files with random names.
